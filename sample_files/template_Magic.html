        <h4>Dear Prof. {name},</h4>
        <p>I hope you are doing well. <b>This is Magic template</b>
            I am Danial Ebrat and I have completed my <b>M.Sc. Computer Science</b>
            in Data Mining at <b>Polytechnic of Tehran (Amirkabir University of Technology)</b>.
            I am considering applying to the {univeristy}'s Ph.D. program and it would be an honor
            to join your research group{group}.</p>


        <p>I&apos;m extremely engrossed in <b>interdisciplinary</b> researches related to <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> and Magic. I enjoy connecting Muggles with our word using my research.
            My master&apos;s thesis was <b>&quot;AI generated Magic Wands"</b> which uses cutting edge appraoches to generate new wands.
            The abstract can be found <b><a href="https://danialebrat.com">here</a></b>,
            and currently, I'm writing the article to hopefully publish at the IWWW (Institute of Wizards and Witches world) this year.
            I&apos;m interested in expanding my research by connecting AI and Magic to
            various fields related to <b>CHERT</b> such as <b>PERT</b> especially associated with Haminjoory.</p>

            <p>Besides my researches, I&apos;m working as an <b>Under Cover Magician</b> at a high-tech company in Iran.
            I&apos;m a member of the <b>research and development</b> group and we mainly focus on cutting-edge problems in Magic AI.

        <p>I wonder if you would be so kind as to read my CV (which is available <b><a href="https://danialebrat.com/#resume">here</a></b>,
            also attached) and let me know if it could be acceptable to pursue my education towards a Ph.D. degree under your supervision. </p>

        <p>I look very much forward to hearing back from you. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.</p>

        <h4>Sincerely,</h4>
